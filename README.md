🔐 Secure Password Generator (Web-Based)
This is a beginner-friendly web app that generates secure passwords based on user preferences. Built with Flask (Python) and a minimal web frontend, it’s a great starting point for anyone learning SaaS concepts or web development.

📚 How the System Works — Step-by-Step with Explanation
🧠 Backend Logic (Flask: main.py)
The system starts a Flask web server that listens for two routes:

/ → renders the main HTML page (user interface)

/generate → handles POST requests to create a password

When the user submits their password settings (length, include uppercase, etc.), the frontend sends a JSON POST request to /generate.

Flask receives this data using request.get_json().

It then checks which options the user selected:

Always includes lowercase letters by default

Adds uppercase letters if selected

Adds numbers if selected

Adds symbols (like @#$) if selected

If the user didn’t select any option, it returns an error saying "No character sets selected."

If valid options are selected, it randomly picks characters from the combined set to build a password of the specified length.

Finally, the server responds with the generated password as a JSON object.

🌐 Frontend Logic (HTML/JavaScript: index.html)
When the page loads, it displays a form that allows the user to:

Set password length

Toggle checkboxes for uppercase, numbers, and symbols

When the user clicks “Generate,” JavaScript:

Reads the form values

Sends a JSON POST request to /generate on the backend

When the server replies with a password, the script:

Displays it in a formatted box

Enables the “Copy” button

If the user clicks “Copy,” it uses the browser’s clipboard API to copy the password and shows an alert that it was copied successfully.

🛠️ Summary of the Flow
User opens app → Flask serves index.html

User sets options → JavaScript collects input

User clicks Generate → JS sends request to /generate

Flask builds password → responds with JSON result

Frontend displays result → user can copy it to clipboard
